  * Must be played by at least 5 players (3 good guys and 2 bad guys
  * Bad guys know who the other bad guys are; the good guys only know that they are the good guys, not anyone else.
  * Players take turns on being the group leader.
  * The group leader chooses a specific number of people to go on a mission (e.g. for 5 players, mission 1 goes to players 1 and 2, mission 2 goes players 3 to 5)
  * All players vote to approve/disapprove of the teams.
  * Each team members in a mission plays either a success or a fail card.
  * A mission fails if there is at least 1 fail card.
  * The first side to reach 3 victories is the winner (3 successes for good guys or 3 fails for bad guys).
